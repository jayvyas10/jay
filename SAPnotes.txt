function is used for the reuseability of code

two type of var 
global and local 

a="hello world"------- global var
def class ()
b=10------ local var
c=5------ local var
d=b+c
print (d)
 --total of 33 keywords are there in  py:
two type of datatypes
sequancial

checking  datatype ex--- 
a=10
print(a)
print(type(a))

arithmetic operator 
def class ()
b=10
c=5
d=b+c
print(d)

assignment op 
x = 5 
x *= 3
print (x)

comparison op
a=5 
b=6
print(a==b)
print(a!=b)

logical op
a=5
print(a>4 and A<6)'

input 
a=int(input ("please enter your digit "))


STRINGS
collection of characters

two type of indexing 
positive and negative 


tuple is inmutable 

TYPE CASTING:
in py the type casting is use to change a little types of the prgram 
this specific chagne is know as type casting

broadcasting 
when we have to perform mathematical op on two diffrent array having diffrent dimension... this performing of program between two array is called broadcasting 
 numpy also have stastical function as wrll for analyisis of the data
 np.amin()
np.amax()
np.mean()
np.median()
np.mode()
